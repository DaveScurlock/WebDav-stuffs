    <p>Hi! I started coding in January 2022 and have been learning using Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path.</p>
    <p>These are the projects I've built as part of this course and while generally messing around:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="Codecademy Challenge - Cheat Sheet/index.html"><strong>Codecademy Challenge: Cheat Sheet</strong></a> <i>(12 March | 17% course completion)</i> - The task was to document at least one 
        HTML or CSS topic. Unfortunately, I totally failied to pay attention to the brief - I was meant to use HTML tables to display 
        the information. But I nailed the use of custom color scheme (by copying the colours from the Google Chrome dev tools) 
        and by using custom styles and monospace font with a different background color for any code (by not including any!)... Basically, a bit of a fail!<br></li>
      <li><strong>Setting up a Rasberry Pi...</strong></a> <i>(17 March | 18% course completion)</i> - I think I've just managed to set up VS code and git on a Rasberry Pi.. that's a project, right?? 
        By the way, I've been super busy with work, hence being slow making any progress on coding!<br></li>
      <li><a href="./Codecademy Challenge - Website Design System/index.html"><strong>Codecademy Challenge: Web Design System</strong></a> <i>(17 March | 18% course completion)</i> - This task was
        to create a style guide/design system for a website. Pretty basic stuff, but also quite ironic as I spent a lot of time figuring out what I wanted this site to 
        look like to inform what another site might look like..! In the end, I settled for just making a site
        that missed the point of the task (it's hardly a helpful design system), but was fun to make
        and made me feel good. Also, I found this amazing tool for chosing 
        color pallets: <a href="https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/" target="_blank">Canva color-wheel</a></li>
      <li><a href="Codecademy Challenge - Tea Cozy/home.html"><strong>Codecademy Challenge: Tea Cozy</strong></a> <i>(12 March | 19% course completion)</i> - [Some detail goes here] </li>
      </ol>
    <p>Note that I am trying to limit the amount of time I spend on any one project as I am more interested in learning and developing than perfecting at the moment. 
      Also, that I will try to resist the urge to go back and “fix” projects, so that I have a 
      fairly accurate record of my progression. </p>
