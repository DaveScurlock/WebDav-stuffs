  <p>Hi! I started coding in January 2022 and have been learning using Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path.</p>

  <p>These are the projects I've built as part of this course and while generally messing around</p>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="Codecademy Challenge (Cheat Sheet)/index.html">Challenge: Cheat Sheet</a> <i>(12 March | 17% course completion)</i> - The task was to document at least one 
      HTML or CSS topic. Unfortunately, I totally failied to pay attention to the brief - I was meant to use HTML tables to display 
      the information. But I nailed the use of custom color scheme (by copying the colours from the Google Chrome dev tools) 
      and by using custom styles and monospace font with a different background color for any code (by not including any!)... Basically, a bit of a fail!</li>
  </ol>
