  <p>Hi! I started coding in January 2022 and have been learning using Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path.</p>
  <p>These are the projects I've built as part of this course and while generally messing around:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="Codecademy Challenge (Cheat Sheet)/index.html">Codecademy Challenge: Cheat Sheet</a> <i>(12 March | 17% course completion)</i> - The task was to document at least one 
      HTML or CSS topic. Unfortunately, I totally failied to pay attention to the brief - I was meant to use HTML tables to display 
      the information. But I nailed the use of custom color scheme (by copying the colours from the Google Chrome dev tools) 
      and by using custom styles and monospace font with a different background color for any code (by not including any!)... Basically, a bit of a fail!<br></li>
    <li>Setting up a Rasberry Pi...</a> <i>(17 March | 18% course completion)</i> - I think I've just managed to set up VS code and git on a rasberry pi.. that's a project, right?? 
      By the way, I've been super busy with work, hence being slow making any progress on coding!<br></li>
    <li><a href="./Codecademy Challenge - Website Design System/index.html">Codecademy Challenge: Web Design System</a> <i>(17 March | 18% course completion)</i> - This task was
      to create a style guide/design system for a website. Pretty basic stuff, but also quite ironic as I spent a lot of time figuring out what I wanted this site to 
    look like to inform what another site might look like..! Bit dull, but still kinda fun. Also, I found this amazing tool for chosing 
  color pallets: <a href="https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/" target="_blank">Canva color-wheel</a></li>
